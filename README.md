## WebApp with different mini-games

Simple SPA to practice fullstack development in different (maybe multiplayer!!!) games.

Technologies stack:
- Spring boot
- ReactJS
- SASS

To try it out you'll need to install 11 java & nodejs (dunno about gradle).

### Build & run:

Firstly install all nodejs garbage:

`npm install`

With single terminal command:

`gradlew webpack`

To speed up a process of debugging you can rebuild bundle.js with:

`npm run build`

and then hotswap (if you're using idea: ctrl + shift + F9).

## Important TODOs
1. Add svg dots.
2. Add SASS.
3. Add docker (just4fun).
