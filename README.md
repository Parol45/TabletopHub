## WebApp with different mini-games

Just SPA to practice fullstack development in different (maybe multiplayer!!!) games

### Build & run with:
`npm run watch`

then

`gradlew bootrun`

## Important TODOs
- Merge two run commands into some kind of gradle script 
- Change name of npm run script
- Add docker (just4fun)
